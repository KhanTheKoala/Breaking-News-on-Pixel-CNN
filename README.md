This repository contains my final project for PHYS 449, Machine Learning in Physics, wherein I investigated the ability of classical and modern generative models to learn and reproduce equilibrium distributions of the two-dimensional Ising model. 

Using high-quality Markov Chain Monte Carloe (MCMC) data across three temperature regimes, I trained a Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and an autoregressive PixelCNNs, evaluating each model’s capacity to capture observables such as energy, magnetization, and specific heat. 

Included is a NeurIPS style paper, MCMC Data, PixelCNN models, RBM models and samples, analysis, and figures that I created for this project.
